## Potential Updates
* Install the correct version of bootstrap for the version of react-bootstrap we are using (will cause some styling issues). <br />
* Use a different Gantt chart than Google charts, or make custom Gantt. <br />
* Send emails out to the users assigned to a project when updates happen. <br />
* Make dashboard tailorable for the user.
